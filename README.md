# Car Emission & Cost Comparison Tool

This project is a web-based application that allows users to compare the carbon emissions and fuel costs of two selected car models. The tool aims to help users make informed decisions about eco-friendly and cost-effective vehicles.

## Features
- Dropdown selection for two cars from a predefined list.
- Displays CO₂ emissions (kg/km) and fuel consumption cost (Rp/km) for both cars.
- Highlights the percentage difference in emissions and costs between the two cars.
- Provides conclusions about efficiency based on comparisons.

## How It Works
1. Select two cars from the dropdown menus.
2. The tool fetches emission and cost data from the predefined dataset.
3. Results are dynamically calculated and displayed:
   - CO₂ Emission comparison.
   - Fuel consumption cost comparison.
   - Conclusion about the efficiency of the second car compared to the first.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: Structure of the web page.
- **CSS (Bootstrap)**: Styling and responsive layout.
- **JavaScript**: Logic for data handling and calculations.
- **Dataset**: Predefined list of cars with emission and cost data.

## Dataset
The dataset used in the project contains information about various car models, their CO₂ emissions (kg/km), and cost per km (Rp). You can update or expand the dataset in the `vehicleData` array inside the script.
